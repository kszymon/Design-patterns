**Project Title: Design Patterns**

**Description:**
This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of various design patterns implemented in Java, grouped into three main directories: Behavioral Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Creational Patterns. Each pattern is meticulously implemented, demonstrating its application and usage in the context of software design.

**Implemented Behavioral Patterns:**
1. **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing, and logging of requests.
2. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:** Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing each handler to decide either to process the request or pass it along the chain.
3. **Template Method Pattern:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
4. **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
5. **Visitor Pattern:** Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
6. **Memento Pattern:** Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
7. **State Pattern:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
8. **Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Implemented Creational Patterns:**
1. **Builder Pattern:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
2. **Abstract Factory Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
3. **Factory Method Pattern:** Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating an instance of one of several possible classes.
4. **Factory Method (Static) Pattern:** Implements the Factory Method as a static method within a class, eliminating the need to instantiate the factory class.
5. **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to this instance.

**Implemented Structural Patterns:**
1. **Adapter Pattern:** Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
2. **Decorator Pattern:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
3. **Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.
4. **Proxy Pattern:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
5. **Flyweight Pattern:** Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.

**Language and Technologies:**
The project is written in Java, showcasing the practical implementation of these design patterns. It serves as an educational resource for developers looking to understand and apply design patterns effectively in their projects.
